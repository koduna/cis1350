            This website is dedicated to us getting married. It tells the story of the how we got together, how we plan to tie the knot
            and how the wedding not only is going to go, but how the wedding went after the fact. Please enjoy viewing the website and
            feel free to share the story with others by word of mouth.

        <h2>History of the Website</h2>
        <p>
            The current history of the website: This website was created in the year 2015, in October. The website had two main reasons
            for being created. One, the website was meant as a memento to our wedding, and as a fun thing to look back on later on in life,
            maybe even show the kids and/or grandkids what we were like on our wedding day and just before. Two, the website actually will
            be graded by a teacher for certain requirements, and that to me will help out with making the website more complete and better
            formated.

            Created by Jonathon Patrick, the events of the wedding are real, but not all location or times are real.
